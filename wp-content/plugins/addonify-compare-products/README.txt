== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin works in all themes? = 

Yes, Addonify Product Compare should work with all themes if the theme authors haven't overridden the default WooCommerce template files. If you notice any issue with your theme, please let us know or ask your theme author to check the compatibility with our plugin.

= Can I select what fields show inside the compare table? = 

Yes, you can select the fields from Dashboard > Addonify > Compare > Settings to display in the compare table.

= Is there a shortcode for adding product compare button?

Yes, there is. Use `[addonify_compare_button]` to add product compare button. `product_id` , `button_label`, `classes`, and `button_icon_position` are the shortcode attributes that can be used. Shortcode attribute, `product_id` is required in order to display the compare button outside the products loop. Value for shortcode attribute `classes` should be CSS classes separated by a space. The value for `button_icon_position`, should be either 'left', 'right' or 'none';.
