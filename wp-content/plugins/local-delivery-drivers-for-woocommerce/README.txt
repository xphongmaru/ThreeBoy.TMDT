## Features

## New Delivery Drivers User Role
This plugin adds a new user role called 'Delivery Drivers' to your WooCommerce store. 

The store owner can use this role to manage delivery driver details, work availability, and order assignments. 

With this feature, you can easily keep track of your delivery team and streamline your order fulfillment process.

## New Delivery Statuses for your WooCommerce store
This plugin enhances your WooCommerce store by introducing three order statuses to track better and manage the delivery process. 

These statuses are: 'Driver Assigned,' 'Failed Delivery Attempt,' and 'Out for Delivery.' 
These updates will keep your customers informed and help your business run smoothly.

* "Driver Assigned" - This status shows that a delivery driver has been assigned to the order. It helps you track which driver is handling which deliveries.

* "Failed Delivery Attempt" - If a delivery driver tries to deliver an order but is unable to (e.g. the customer is not home or the delivery address is incorrect), this status records the failed attempt. It helps you track any issues that may have occurred during the delivery process and communicate with customers about when to expect a second attempt.

* "Out for Delivery" - This status shows that the delivery driver is in the process of delivering the order. In addition, it indicates that the shipment is on its way to the customer and is expected to arrive soon.

## ASSIGNING DELIVERY DRIVERS TO ORDERS
The store owner has the ability to assign delivery drivers to orders on the admin panel's order page. 

Once a delivery driver is assigned to an order, the order's status will be updated to 'Driver assigned.


## ORDERS NOTES
The "Local Delivery Drivers for WooCommerce" plugin saves all actions the delivery driver takes on the order notes. 

This allows you to track the progress of each delivery and see any comments or updates made by the driver. 

By keeping a record of all delivery-related activities on the order notes, you can improve communication and transparency within your team, ultimately leading to more efficient and successful deliveries.

## DELIVERY DRIVERS MOBILE-FRIENDLY PANEL
The "Local Delivery Drivers for WooCommerce" plugin includes a mobile-friendly panel that allows delivery drivers to manage their deliveries from their smartphones. 

The panel has a convenient, app-like interface and can be added to the mobile homepage for easy access.

The delivery drivers panel includes screens for each order status, including a dashboard, driver assigned orders, out for delivery, failed delivery, and delivered orders. 

On the dashboard, drivers can update their availability and view the total number of orders in each status. 

The "driver assigned" screen shows all orders assigned to the driver, while the "out for delivery" screen displays all orders on the current delivery route. 

The "failed delivery" and "delivered" screens allow drivers to view their completed orders from today, yesterday, this month, and last month. 

Overall, the delivery drivers panel provides an easy-to-use interface for managing deliveries on the go.


## ORDER PAGE SCREEN
On the order page, delivery drivers can view all the relevant details for an order, such as the billing and shipping addresses, items included in the order, and any comments left by the customer or dispatch center. 

They can also easily update the order's status to "delivered" or "failed attempt" and leave comments for other team members to see. 

Additionally, the delivery driver can quickly call the customer or dispatch center directly from the order page if needed.
