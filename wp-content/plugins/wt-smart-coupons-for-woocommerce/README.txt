### ADVANCED WOOCOMMERCE COUPON FEATURES TO LEVEL UP YOUR WOOCOMMERCE MARKETING ###

<strong>Easily apply coupons</strong>: Each coupon has a coupon code associated with it. Usually, customers are required to enter this WooCommerce discount code in the allowed field for applying a coupon to their purchase. However, this task can be made shorter by smart coupons as it displays all the coupons available for the customer on the Cart & My Account page to easily apply them. This streamlines the coupon application process, increasing coupon usage and reducing abandoned carts.

<strong>WooCommerce coupon management</strong>: Managing coupons no longer has to be a manual task. Smart coupons handle everything automatically, from issuing new discounts to removing expired ones. Store admins can focus on growing their business instead of constantly overseeing promotions.

<strong>Promote specific payment or shipping methods</strong>: Provide WooCommerce coupons based on payment or shipping methods that are most suitable for your business needs. Encouraging preferred transaction methods enhances the customer experience and also provides opportunities to collaborate with vendors, creating mutually beneficial incentives.

<strong>Duplicate coupons</strong>: Instead of setting up a new offer from scratch, existing coupon configurations can be copied and reused, ensuring consistency while saving time on campaign setup.
